WHY I WANTED TO BUILD THIS:

As far as I could tell, there was no digital notebook expressly for music thoughts, so I wanted to fill that void. While commuting, or taking a long walk, I often wanted to listen to music and write a little bit about what I was hearing. So this app solves that problem in an easy, organized way.  

CHALLENGES:

The biggest challenges here were normal ones. Making sure I was hitting the backend. Making sure smaller features like Sort and Search were working. Getting the app smooth and usable was the biggest obstacle. 

FUTURE IMPLEMENTATIONS:

Moving forward, I would like to connect each entry to the music itself. Clicking on an album title could take you to Bandcamp or Spotify, for example. It would also be fun to have a social media angle here, where you could share your entries on Twitter or Instagram.
